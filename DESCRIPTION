Title: Helper functions to make creating cloze quiz questions in rmarkdown for Moodle via the exams package easier
Version: 0.3.1
Author: Ole Boysen
Maintainer: Ole Boysen <ole.boysen@ucd.ie>
Description: This package provides a number of little helper functions to be used in the rmarkdown code for the creation of Moodle cloze quiz questions. 
    These functions make the creation of questions quicker and reduce the potential for introducing mistakes.
    The rmarkdown quiz is then converted by the exams package's exams2moodle() function to produce an .xml file in Moodle format which then can be imported to Moodle.
    Use file.edit(system.file('examples',package='moodleClozeHelpers','cloze_quiz_example.Rmd')) to view a short example quiz Rmd file.
